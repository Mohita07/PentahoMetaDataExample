# PentahoMetaDataExample


Metadata is used for reusability. Here, I have used metadata to copy table data from one table to another (in this case MYSQL, can be done for other databases as well).
This is the initial version. Parameters required to run the job are-
-> SOURCE_TABLE
-> SOURCE_SCHEMA
-> TARGET_TABLE
-> TARGET_SCHEMA
You can use the given MySQL dump for creating tables.
